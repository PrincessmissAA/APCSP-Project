## Credits
### Card images came from Dulaya's repo
Project videopoker: https://github.com/Dulaya/videopoker.git

Everything else was programmed by me from scratch using Javascript.

## Directions
On the web page, in the textbox enter in any number.  Then hit the deal button.

* one of three things will happen
     * if the number entered is less than one, no cards will be displayed
     * if the number of cards is over 26, 26 cards will be dealt to each player
     * if the number of cards is between 1 and 26 inclusively, the inputted number of cards will be dealt to each player
